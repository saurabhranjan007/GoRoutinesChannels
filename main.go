// Go Routinesüìù: Go Routines help in concurrent programming.
// 		When a go program runs it executes the main routine (threat) and executes from top-to-bottom order. And can not execute anything else until one code block is done executing.
// 		Go Routines: help with concurrent programming (running multiple threads at once).

// Go Channelüìù: In general main go routine does not care if a child routine is done processing and we might not be able to track the progress of these concurrent programs,
// 		that's where go channels come into place, channels create link between main and child routines(threads) so that main routine is aware of the child routine status.
// 		One go channel can only communicate through one data type, meaning channel of int will not communicate string data.

// Function LIteralüìù: have the same behaviour as anonymous functions in JavaScript. In go function literals are unnamed functions that gets wrapped with some chunk of codes
// 		which could be executed at some point in future.
